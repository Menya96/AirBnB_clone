This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

A command-line interpreter (CLI), also known as a command-line interface or shell, is a program that allows users to interact with the operating system through text-based commands. Here’s a detailed overview:

Description
A command-line interpreter enables users to enter and execute commands directly in an operating system. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which rely on visual elements, a CLI uses text commands to perform tasks. This allows for automation, direct access to system functions, and the use of commands not available in GUI software12.

How to Start It
The method to start a command-line interpreter depends on the operating system:

Windows:
Command Prompt: Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
PowerShell: Press Win + X, select Windows PowerShell.
macOS: Open Terminal from the Applications > Utilities folder.
Linux: Open Terminal from the applications menu or use the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + T.
